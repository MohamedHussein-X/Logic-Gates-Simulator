# Why to do ?
A logic circuit is a collection of interconnected logic components, such as gates, flip-flops, wires 
or even embedded circuits. Each component has a set of input pins and a set of output pins. A 
connection can be created between any two components by connecting an output pin of a 
component to an input pin of another component. It is not possible, however, to connect an output 
pin to another output pin, or an input pin to another input pin. If an output pin happens to source 
multiple input pins each connection should have a separate connector. Gates, on the other hand, 
are components with one or more input pins and only one output pin. Each circuit component 
manipulates the values applied to its input pins to calculate corresponding output. Two special 
components are the switch and the LED. The switch is a component with no input pins but has one 
output pin. The LED on the other hand has one input pin and zero output pin.
Complicated logic circuits can be very hard to trace, this is why computer-aided design of logic 
circuits is necessary. One of the very powerful tools is a simulator, which simulates the operation of 
an entire logic circuit and predicts the outputs based on the inputs.
